                Welcome to {appName}. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your
                access to and use of our web application and related services
                (collectively, the "Service"), offered by {companyName}. By
                accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
                Terms.

            <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
                {appName} is a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to
                generate quiz questions from user-provided text. Users can log in
                using their Google account. The Service offers a daily limit of
                free generations. Registered users can purchase additional credits
                ("Credits") to increase their generation limit via our payment
                processor, Stripe.
            </p>

            <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>
                To access certain features, such as a higher daily generation
                limit and the ability to purchase Credits, you must register and
                log in using your Google account. You are responsible for
                maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all
                activities that occur under it. You agree to notify us
                immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Purchase and Use of Credits</h2>
            <p>
                Registered users can purchase packages of Credits (currently, 5
                Credits per purchase) through Stripe. Each Credit allows for one
                additional quiz generation beyond the free daily limit.
