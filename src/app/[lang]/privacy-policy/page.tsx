            <p>
                We collect several different types of information for various
                purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Account Information (via Google Login):</strong> When
                    you register or log in using Google, we collect basic profile
                    information from your Google account, such as your name, email
                    address, and unique Google identifier. We use this to create
                    and manage your {appName} account.

                <li>
                    <strong>Payment Information (via Stripe):</strong> When you
                    purchase Credits, the transaction is processed directly by
                    Stripe. We do not store your full credit or debit card details.
                    Stripe provides us with limited transaction information (like
                    payment success and an identifier) so we can credit your
                    account. Stripe acts as an independent data controller for the
                    payment data it processes. You can review Stripe's privacy
